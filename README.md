## 📚 What I Learned

This project was an excellent exercise in building a semantically correct component. Here are the key takeaways:

- **HTML Semantics:** I used an `<article>` element to wrap the card component, as it represents a self-contained composition that makes sense on its own.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Defined global CSS custom properties (variables) for the base colors and spacings according to the style guide.
- **Layout & Centering:** Centered the card perfectly by applying Flexbox to both the `body` and `main` elements. This technique also naturally pushes the footer to the bottom of the viewport.
- **Component Layout:** Used Flexbox inside the card to align its elements (image, title, text) neatly, utilizing the `gap` property for precise spacing without margins.
